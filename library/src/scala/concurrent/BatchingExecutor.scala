/**
 * Mixin trait for an Executor
 * which groups multiple nested `Runnable.run()` calls
 * into a single Runnable passed to the original
 * Executor. This can be a useful optimization
 * because it bypasses the original context's task
 * queue and keeps related (nested) code on a single
 * thread which may improve CPU affinity. However,
 * if tasks passed to the Executor are blocking
 * or expensive, this optimization can prevent work-stealing
 * and make performance worse.
 * A batching executor can create deadlocks if code does
 * not use `scala.concurrent.blocking` when it should,
 * because tasks created within other tasks will block
 * on the outer task completing.
 * This executor may run tasks in any order, including LIFO order.
 * There are no ordering guarantees.
 *
 * WARNING: Only use *EITHER* `submitAsyncBatched` OR `submitSyncBatched`!!
 *
 * When you implement this trait for async executors like thread pools,
 * you're going to need to implement it something like the following:
 *
 * {{{
 *  final override def submitAsync(runnable: Runnable): Unit =
 *    super[SuperClass].execute(runnable) // To prevent reentrancy into `execute`
 *
 *  final override def execute(runnable: Runnable): Unit =
 *    if (runnable.isInstanceOf[Batchable]) // Or other logic
 *      submitAsyncBatched(runnable)
 *    else
 *      submitAsync(runnable)
 *
 *  final override def reportFailure(cause: Throwable): Unit = â€¦
 *  }}}
 *
 *  And if you want to implement if for a sync, trampolining, executor you're
 *  going to implement it something like this:
 *
 * {{{
 *  final override def submitAsync(runnable: Runnable): Unit = ()
 *
 *  final override def execute(runnable: Runnable): Unit =
 *    submitSyncBatched(runnable) // You typically will want to batch everything
 *
 *  final override def reportFailure(cause: Throwable): Unit =
 *    ExecutionContext.defaultReporter(cause) // Or choose something more fitting
 * }}}
 *
